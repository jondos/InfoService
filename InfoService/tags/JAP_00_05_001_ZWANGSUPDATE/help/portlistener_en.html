<H2>Portlistener</H2>

<P>
For JAP to anonymize communication over the internet, it must be connected between the browser and the server in the internet.  This type of intermediate station is generally called a proxy.  Most programs that communicate with the internet can connect through such a proxy.  The necessary settings for such a connection are: the name of the computer (host) on which the proxy is running, and the port number under which the proxy accepts requests.  In the case of JAP, the host is the local computer itself and the port number is 4001 as default.  This setting can almost always be left at the default.

    Enter the port number at which JAP should accept connections from your browser here.  Please note that the settings in your browser also need to be <a href="browser_en.html">changed</a>, if you make changes here.

    If you check this box, only your own computer can connect to JAP.  If the box is left unchecked, all computers that can connect to your computer can connect to JAP and use it to surf anonymously.  For security reasons, it is recommended that this box be left cleared as long as you don't have a specific reason to allow other computers access to JAP running on your computer.
