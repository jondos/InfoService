<B>Info Service Connection Error</B>

<P>
When you try to activate the anonymized access, a pop-up window with the
following message appears: <I>Error contacting the JAP information service</I>.

<UL>
    <LI> Please check the settings concerning the Info Service. The following
    values have to be set: Host:&nbsp;infoservice.inf.tu-dresden.de,
    Port:&nbsp;6543. If this is not the case, please correct these settings.
    <LI> Please check if the connection to the web is working properly.
    <LI> Please check if your computer is protected by a firewall. If this is
    the case, ask your systems administrator to release port 6543. If
    you cannot provide this, unfortunately you cannot use JAP. For future
    versions it is planned to direct communication with the Info Service or
    first mix via HTTP proxy. This would solve your problem.
    <LI> If none of the points above fit your problem, it is probably not on
    your side. In this case we ask you to be patient and try again later.

<B>First Mix Connection Error</B>

<P>
When you try to activate the anonymized access, a pop-up window with the

    <LI> Please check if your computer is protected by a firewall. If this is
    the case, ask your systems administrator to release the port provided in
    the address of the mix. If you cannot provide this, unfortunately you
    cannot use JAP. For future versions it is planned to
    direct communication with the first mix via HTTP proxy. This
    would solve your problem.
