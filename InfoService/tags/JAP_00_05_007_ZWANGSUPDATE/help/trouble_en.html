<P>
<B>InfoService Connection Error</B>

<P>
When you try to activate anonymized access, a pop-up window with the
following message appears: <I>Error contacting the JAP information service</I>.

<UL>
    <LI> Please check the settings concerning the InfoService. The following
    values have to be set: Host:&nbsp;infoservice.inf.tu-dresden.de,
    Port:&nbsp;6543. If this is not the case, please correct these settings.
    <LI> Please check if your connection to the internet is working properly.
    <LI> Please check if your computer is protected by a firewall. If this is
    the case, ask your system administrator to release port 6543. Unfortunately, if
    you cannot provide this, you cannot use JAP. Direct communication with the InfoService or
    first mix via HTTP proxy is planned in future versions, which would solve this problem.
    <LI> If none of the points above fit your problem, it is probably not on
    your side. In this case we ask you to be patient and try again later.

    you cannot provide this, you cannot use JAP. Direct communication with the InfoService or
    first mix via HTTP proxy is planned in future versions, which would solve this problem.
