Java Anon Proxy</h2>
<b>The Java Anon Proxy (JAP)</b>
<p>The Java Anon Proxy (JAP) provides the possibility to surf the web without
being observed. This means that neither the requested server nor any observer
on the lines get to know which user has viewed which web page.
<p>The JAP has to be installed on the internet user's computer to allow
them to surf the internet anonymously and without being observed. This
is necessary because for the purpose of anononymization all requests and
also the servers' answers have to be anonymized.
<p>This function is achieved by sending the communication connection not
directly to the web server but via a so-called Mix Proxy Cascade. These
are interposed stations via which all messages are directed.
<p>Since many users make use of the anon service at the same time, the
internet connections of each user are hidden between those of all the other
users: Every user could have been responsible for any connection. Nobody,
no outstanding person, no other user, not even the operator of the anon
service can determine which internet connections were requested by a certain
user.
<p><b>The anon service</b>
<p>In general, at least three mix proxies will work at an anon service,
each of them being operated by an independent institution that has declared
in a self-obligation statement to neither store log files of the transported
connections nor exchange sensitive data with the other mix proxy operators.
<p>However, since none of the interposed stations shall be trusted completely,
all data to be sent are going to be encrypted several times (once per station).
<p>The encryption of the requests and the Decipherment of the answers take
place in the JAP. The user only has to <a href="config_en.html">configure</a>
their browser in a way that all WWW requests are directed via the JAP.
<p>The users' anonymization takes place by sending each request in multiply
encrypted form via a series of in-between stations based on the mix concept
of David Chaum. Since all users' behavior is the same in the final version
(sending the same amount of data per time unit via the same series of mixes)
and assuming that at least one mix is not cooperating with a global attacker,
a single user's actions can no longer be reconstructed.
<p>It is our aim to provide a service that really satisfies these demands.
<p><b>Attention!</b> The current version does not reach this security level,
because the software is still in the state of development! However, this
version guarantees a much higher security standard than e.g. systems that
work as simple proxy servers.
<p>The given version provides user anonymity protection at least against
local attackers (e.g. the provider, web server, the boss). In addition,
it provides protection against us - the mix operators. Dependent on what
mix we operate, we can only receive information on which participant (IP
address) uses the service or which requests have been sent to the web,
but no combination of these two possibilities.
<p>The current version does not provide protection against attackers who
observe all internet lines or the first and the last mix, respectively.
<p>For the following reasons we want to offer the system already now:
<ul>
<li>
We have to gather experience with a running system to get to know still
included mistakes and problems in practice and to be able to overcome them.</li>

<li>
For being able to offer a secure service, we need a large and stabile anonymity
group from the beginning. We hope to gain such a group already now and
to be able to hold it during the time of further development.</li>
</ul>
For achieving this aim, we need your help. We would be very graceful if
you would use the anon service permanently and tell us about your problems,
opinions, and suggestions.
