<P>
<B>Java Anon Proxy (JAP)</B>

<P>
Java Anon Proxy (JAP) provides the functionality to surf the web without 
being observed. This means that neither the requested server nor any 
observer on the Internet get to know which user has viewed which web page.

<P>
The JAP has to be installed on the user's computer to allow him to surf the 
internet anonymously and without being observed. This is necessary since 
all requests and also the servers' answers have to be sent not directly to 
the web server but via a so-called Mix Proxy Cascade. These mixes are 
interposed stations, and all messages are directed through these stations.

<P>
Since many users make use of the anon service at the same time, the 
internet connections of each user are hidden among those of all the other 
users: Every user could have been responsible for any connection. Nobody, 
no outstanding person, no other user, not even the operator of the anon 
service can determine which internet connections were requested by a 
certain user.

<P>
<B>The anon service</B>

<P>
In general, at least three mix proxies will work at an anon service, each 
of them operated by an independent institution that has declared in a 
self-obligation statement to neither store log files of the transported 
connections nor exchange sensitive data with the other mix proxy operators.

<P>
However, since none of the interposed stations shall be trusted completely, 
all data to be sent is encrypted several times (once per mix station).

<P>
The encryption of the requests and the decryption of the answers take place 
in the JAP. The user only has to <A HREF="config_en.html">configure</A> the 
browser in a way that all web requests are directed through the JAP.

<P>
The users' anonymization takes place by sending each request in multiply 
encrypted form via a series of in-between stations based on the mix concept 
of David Chaum. Since all users' behavior is the same in the final version 
(sending the same amount of data per time unit via the same cascade of 
mixes) and assuming that at least one mix is not cooperating with a global 
attacker, a single user's actions cannot be reconstructed.

<P>
<B>Attention!</B> The current version does not reach this security level, 
because the software is still under development! However, this version 
guarantees a much higher security standard than systems that work as simple 
proxy servers.

<P>
This version of JAP provides protection at least against local attackers 
(e.g. the provider, web server, your manager or boss). In addition, it 
provides protection against the mix operators. Dependent on what mix we 
operate, we can only get information on which IP address uses the service 
or which requests have been sent to the web, but no combination of these 
two possibilities.

<P>
The current version does not provide protection against attackers who 
observe all Internet lines or the first and the last mix, respectively.

<P>
For the following reasons we want to offer the system prior to the final 
version:

<UL>
    <LI> We want to gather experience with a running system in order to 
    properly improve the system.
    <LI> For being able to offer a secure service, we need a large and stable 
    anonymity group from the beginning. We hope to gain such a group already 
    now and to be able to hold it during the time of further development.
</UL>

<P>
To achieve this aim, we need your help. We would be very grateful if you 
used the anon service permanently and told us about your problems, 
opinions, and suggestions.
