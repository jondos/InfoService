<H2>About JAP</H2>

<B>The JAP AN.ON Proxy</B>

<P>
JAP Anon Proxy provides the functionality to surf the web without
being observed. This means that neither the requested server nor any
observer on the Internet can know which user has viewed which web page.

<P>
JAP has to be installed on the user's computer to allow him to surf the
internet anonymously and without being observed. This is necessary since
all requests and all of the servers' answers have to be sent not directly to
the web server, rather via a so-called <em>Mix Cascade</em>. These mixes are
interposed stations, and all messages are directed through these stations.

<P>
Since many users make use of the anon service at the same time, the
internet connections of each user are hidden among those of all the other
users. Every user could have been responsible for any connection. Nobody,
no outstanding person, no other user, not even the operator of the AN.ON
service can determine which internet connections were requested by a
certain user.

<P>
<B>The AN.ON service</B>

<P>
The AN.ON service consists of several choosable Mix cascades whose Mixes are generally operated by different and independent organisations. These institutions  have declared in a
  <a href="http://anon.inf.tu-dresden.de/operators/help/operatorCommitment_en.html">voluntary commitment</a>  to neither store log files of the transported
connections nor exchange sensitive data with other Mix  operators.

<P>
However, since none of the interposed stations should be trusted completely,
all data to be sent is encrypted several times (once per mix station).

<P>
The encryption of the requests and the decryption of the answers take place
in the JAP program. The user only has to <A HREF="browser_en.html">configure</A> the
browser in a way that all web requests are directed through JAP.

<P>
The users' anonymization takes place by sending each request in multiply
encrypted form via a series of in-between stations based on the mix concept
of David Chaum. Since all users' behavior is the same in the final version
(sending the same amount of data per time unit via the same cascade of
mixes) as long as at least one mix is not cooperating with a global
attacker, a single user's actions cannot be reconstructed.

<P>
Our goal is to provide a service that truly meets these criteria.

<P>
<B>Attention!</B> The current version does not yet reach this security level,
because the software is still under development! However, this version already
guarantees a much higher security standard than systems that work as simple
<a href="proxy_overview_en.html">proxy servers</a>.

<P>
This version of JAP provides protection against local attackers
(e.g. the provider, web server, your manager or boss). In addition, it
provides protection against the mix operators. Dependent on what mix an operator
operates, he can only get information on which IP address uses the service
<b>or</b> which requests have been sent to the web, but no combination of these
two possibilities.

<P>
The current version does not provide protection against attackers who
observe all Internet lines or controls the first and the last mix.

<P>
For the following reasons we want to offer the system prior to the final
version:

<UL>
    <LI> We want to gather experience with a running system in order to
    properly improve the system.
    <LI> For being able to offer a secure service, we need a large and stable
    anonymity group from the beginning. We hope to gain such a group already
    now and be able to maintain it during further development.
</UL>

<P>
To achieve this aim, we need your help. We would be very grateful if you
used the anon service regularly and told us about your problems,
opinions, and suggestions.
