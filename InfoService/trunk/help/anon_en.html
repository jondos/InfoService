Anonymity</h2>
<b>How to use the anonymizing service</b>
<p>On the register card <i>Configuration</i>, the settings and the current
status of the JAP concerning the connection to the anon service is being
displayed the within option <i>Anonymity</i>. If the check for <b>Activate
anonymous Access</b> is activated, the JAP directs all requests via the
anon service. Directly below this, the URL of the first mix is being displayed.
Additionally, there is a status display that provides information about
the service’s usability. If you want to surf anonymously, it must show
<i>Status:
active</i>.
<p>Please note that there must be a connection to the web before the activation,
because the JAP establishes a permanent connection to the first mix. Since
this connection still remains active even if you don’t send any requests
and since status information is exchanged on a regular basis, you should
deactivate the anonymous access before you disconnect from the internet.
<p>Please note additionally that the automatic disconnection does not work
after a certain time of inactivity if the anonymous access is activated.
This is due to the system’s inability to realize the inactivity since the
JAP permanently orders information.
<p><b>Configuration</b>
<p>You can change the URL of the anon service if you want to use a different
mix cascade. For this please click on the button <b>Change</b>.
<p>Now there are three possibilities to call another anon service:
<ul>
<li>
You can ask Info Service to update the locally stored list of anon services.
For this, choose&nbsp; <b>Download</b> and click the load button. This
procedure updates the local database.</li>

<li>
From the local database you can select an anon service by choosing <b>Select
in local Database</b> and clicking on the name of one of the anon service
in the opened dropdown menu.</li>

<li>
Apart from this you have the opportunity to enter the URL of the anon service
manually.</li>
</ul>
Manually entering the anon service as well as changing the URL makes sense
only if there are alternative operators of mix cascades who work with this
protocol. For using the anon service, only the first two settings should
be used.
