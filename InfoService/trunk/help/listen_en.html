<P>
In order to make sure that the JAP is able to anonymize the communication 
with the Internet, it has to be connected between the browser and the 
server in the Internet. Such an in-between station is generally called 
proxy. Most applications that communicate with the Internet can direct 
their connections via such a proxy. A proxy is identified by: The name of 
the computer (host) on which the proxy is operated, and the port number via 
where the proxy is accepting requests. The default port number of JAP is 
4001. This configuration can be kept almost all configurations.

<P>
<B>Essential configurations at the web browser</B>

<P>
You have to make sure that your web browser sends its requests to the web 
via the JAP. Therefore, you have to configure it in a way that it uses the 
JAP as a proxy. Generally, you use the following procedure:

<OL>
    <LI>Identify the proxy configuration in the browser settings.
    <LI> Activate the proxy modus (use proxy server).
    <LI> Enter <B>127.0.0.1</B> into the field Host, and then enter the port 
    number configured in the JAP (default: <B>4001</B>) into the field Port.
</OL>

<B>Changing the port number in JAP</B>

<P>
In very rare cases it may be necessary to change the port number, e.g. if 
the default port is already used by another application in your system. On 
the register card <I>Configuration</I> the current port number of the JAP 
is being displayed in the top frame, which is called <I>Listener Port 
Number</I>. Below this, the current status of the listener is displayed. If 
the listener is running, the display shows <B>Status: active</B>.

<P>
To change the port number, proceed as follows:

<OL>
    <LI>Click the button <B>Settings</B> next to the port number display.
    <LI>Enter the desired port number.
    <LI>Click <B>OK</B>.
    <LI>Check if the desired port number can be used (<B>Status: aktive</B> 
    must be displayed). If this is not the case, try another port number.
    <LI>Change the proxy configuration of your web browser respectively.
</OL>
