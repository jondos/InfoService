Trouble Shooting</h2>
<b>Info Service Connection Error</b>
<p>When you try to activate the anonymized access, a pop-up window with
the following message appears: <i>Info Service Connection Error</i>.
<ul>
<li>
Please check the settings concerning the Info Service. The following values
have to be set:</li>

<br>Host: anon.inf.tu-dresden.de, Port: 6543. If this is not the case,
please correct these settings.
<li>
Please check if the connection to the web is working properly.</li>

<li>
Please check if your computer is protected by a firewall. If this is the
case, ask your systems administrator to release port no. 6543. If you cannot
provide this, unfortunately you cannot use the service currently. For future
versions it is planned to direct communication with the first mix via HTTP
proxy (by choice). This would solve your problem.</li>

<li>
If none of the points above fit your problem, it is probably not on your
side. In this case we ask you to wait and try again later.</li>
</ul>
<b>First Mix Connection Error</b>
<p>When you try to activate the anonymized access, a pop-up window with

Please check the settings for the first mix, choose a different cascade
or reload the URL of Info Service.</li>

<li>
Please check if your computer is protected by a firewall. If this is the
case, ask your systems administrator to release the port provided in the
address of the mix. If you cannot provide this, unfortunately you cannot
use the service currently. For future versions it is planned to direct
communication with the first mix via HTTP proxy (by choice). This would
solve your problem.</li>

<li>
If none of the points above fit your problem, it is probably not on your
side. In this case we ask you to wait and try again later.</li>
