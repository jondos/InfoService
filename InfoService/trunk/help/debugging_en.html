<H2>Debugging</H2>

<P>
Here you can configure how many status and error messages appear at the console while running JAP (for example a DOS window console).  If you're having problems with JAP, you might be able to localize them using these error messages.  If you're unable to find the solution and request help from us, you should definitely attach the appropriate error messages to your e-mail.

<P>
By setting the checkboxes for the appropriate topics, you can choose whether you want to receive messages concerning that topic.  With the sliding bar, you can choose the level of importance a message must have in order to be shown on the console.  If it's at the very bottom, only messages that concern severe problems that prevent correct functioning of the service will be shown.

<P>
Please read the <A HREF="trouble_en.html">troubleshooting</A> page as well.

<P>
If the "Show messages in a separate Window" box is checked, a separate window will appear for debug messages.  Within this window, you can copy or save the messages and send them to us by e-mail.  Additionally, you can indicate a file in which the debug messages are to be saved.
