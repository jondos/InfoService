<P>
The Info Service is used to provide JAP with necessary information about
the anonymity service. At the moment this includes:

<UL>
    <LI> The current JAP version number to allow automatic updates.
    <LI> The address of the first mix.
    <LI> Information on the mix cascade, e.g. the public keys of the
    mixes.
    <LI> Information on the service's capacity and the
     level of anonymity achieved by JAP.
</UL>

Please note that the correct information for the InfoService is already set by default.  Changes to these settings could cause JAP to no longer find the anonymization service.
