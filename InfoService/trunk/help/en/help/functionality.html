<H2>Functionality - in a nutshell </H2>
<h3>What JonDo is NOT</h3>
<ul>
  <li>JonDo does NOT hide the IP address of your computer (!) </li>
  <li>JonDo is NO anonymisation tool for filesharing </li>
  <li>JonDo CANNOT anonymise E-Mails (except for web mailers)</li>
  <li>JonDo does NOT integrate transparently into your system, but has to be <a href="browser.html">configured</a> separately for each anonymised application</li>
  <li>JonDo does NOT accelerate your web access </li>
  <li>JonDo is NOT AN.ON (AN.ON is the service provided, JonDo is the client application for accessing this service)</li>
  <li>JonDo CANNOT use arbitrary &quot;anonymous&quot; proxies (for example from lists of open proxies) to establish an anonymous connection. This does only work with AN.ON Mix Cascades, that are <a href="certificates.html">certified</a>, automatically listed in JonDo and do not need to be entered manually. </li>
  <li>JonDo does NOT periodically change its IP address, but keeps the same IP address as long as it is connected to the same Mix Cascade. This may last minutes, hours or even days.</li>
  <li>JonDo is NO One-Click-Anonymisation tool - something like that does and will not really exist!</li>
  <li>JonDo does NOT (yet) filter out <a href="noactive.html">scripts and browser information</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>What JonDo is </h3>
<ul>
  <li>JonDo is an application for conceiling the own IP address when accessing the web with anonymised applications (<a href="supportedPrograms.html">HTTP, FTP-Downloads</a>)</li>
  <li>JonDo is an anti-censorship application (especially by <a href="forwarding_server.html">Fowarding-Server</a>/<a href="forwarding_client.html">Forwarding-Client</a>) that enables access to otherwise blocked websites</li>
  <li>JonDo is open source </li>
  <li>JonDo is free of charge </li>
  <li>JonDo is available for virtually all operating systems </li>
  <li>JonDo may be used (even commercial, except for the name) and modified by everyone</li>
  <li>JonDo is enhanced and developed in cooperation with german universities (<a href="http://dud.inf.tu-dresden.de">TU Dresden</a>, <a href="http://www-sec.uni-regensburg.de">Universit&auml;t Regensburg</a>) and privacy protection organisations (<a href="http://www.datenschutzzentrum.de" target="_blank">Independe</a><a href="http://www.datenschutzzentrum.de" target="_blank">nt Centre for Privacy Protection  Schleswig-Holstein</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h3>What AN.ON is </h3>
<ul>
  <li>AN.ON is the term for the anonymiser service that JonDo connects to</li>
  <li>AN.ON consists of many Mix Cascades of different length (2-4 Mixes) with different and independent Organisations as operators of the individual Mixes, respective</li>
  <li>An AN.ON umbrella organisation (called AN.ON, too) independent from the operators guards the reliability of the individual operator organisations</li>
  <li>AN.ON is partially operated with costs for the users in order to finance enhancements of the software, the preservation of the umbrella organisation and the costs for operating the servers</li>
</ul>
