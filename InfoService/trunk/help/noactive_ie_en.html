<H3>Dataprotection settings on Internet Explorer 6.0</H3>

<P> Commercial webservers often use Cookies, to create user profiles. 
  That's why we recommend to deactivate Cookies in your Browser. Unfortunately, 
  many websites can't be used without Cookies. Partly because the providers of those 
  websites don't want to lose that simple profiling tool.<br>
  The <b>Internet Explorer 6.0</b> provides more extensive settings to manage 
  the Cookies than just turning them off. 
<p> For a simple dataprotection configuration you have the option to import the
  <b>dataprotection settings as file</b>.<br>
  Our configurationfile will make your browser accept Cookies <b>just</b> for the <b>current 
  session</b>. Hence, if you visit the homepage once again you will not be recognized. 
  <br>
  These settings will prevent Cookies from being saved on your harddisk but since 
  Cookies are accept for a 
  short time, you can still access these websites normally. 
<h3>Installing the Dataprotection-Configurationfile</h3>
<ol>
  <li> <b>Download the file</b> 
    <ul>
      <li><A HREF="./internetexplorer/ie_privacy_file.xml" type="application/ffr">ie_privacy_file.xml</A> (<A HREF="http://anon.inf.tu-dresden.de/ie_privacy_file.xml" type="application/ffr">online</A>)
        (Save as file please.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
  <li> <b>Import it</b> 
    <ol>

</ol>
</li>
  <li> The Internet Explorer will confirm the successful import with a message like "Dataprotectionsettingfile 
    was successful imported". </li>
</ol>
<P > <b>Hint:</b> To permit saving of Cookies for some trusted websites,
  you can enter these websites at the dataprotection settings. If you 
  select "Edit", you can add these trusted sites.</p>

<h3>Why aren't the builtin capabilities good enough to configure IE?</h3>

The decision to accept or reject a Cookie in Internet Explorer 6.0 is
based on what the cookie setting party does with the collected
data. Or more precisely, what they <b>declare</b> to do with the data.<br>
This declaration is made in a machine readable Privacy-Policy
(following the P3P-standard).

That policy is downloaded from the respective website and compared to the users's preferences.<br>

Unfortunately this preferences can only be set quite coarsely with the Internet Explorer. 
There is only a ruler with these positions: 
<ul>
  <li>Accept all Cookies.</li>
  <li>4 levels from "high security" to "low security"</li>
  <li>Reject all Cookies.</li>
</ul>

One might assume that Cookies from advertising companies are blocked 
on level &quot;high security&quot; - but it isn't so.

<p> The Cookies of one of the most known web advertisers are still accepted without acknowledgement. 
  The reason is simple. For the decision to accept a cookie it is most relevant whether a provider collects personal 
  data, like name, address etc. , or not. Advertisers claim to collect data strictly
  in referece to a pseudonym and not to a real person.
  Anyway, users will be recognized whenever they visit a site that belongs to the advertisers 
  customers. 
<p>
<h4>A excerpt of user information collected by the above mentioned advertiser:</h4>
<ul>
<!-- TODO: engischen IE greifen und nachlesen wie das tatsaechlich heisst -->
  <li>Information about your financial situation (account balance, behavior to pay bills),</li>
  <li>membership of parties, clubs, religious groups, unions,</li>
  <li>information regarding mentally and physically health, sexual likings, buying 
    products of public health.</li>
</ul>
<p> In the Internet Explorer you can view the P3P-Policy of a website in plain 
  text if that website has a P3P-Policy. Just select menu item "View/Dataprotectionreport...".
