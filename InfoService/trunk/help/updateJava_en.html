<H2>Update Java Software (JRE) </H2>

<P> JAP is written in the Java Programming language and therefore needs an installed <a href="http://java.sun.com">Java</a> for execution. Installing Java, however, leads to the integration of a so-called plugin in your web browser that enables this browser to execute Java web applications (applets). Unfortunately in this plugin, as in each software, quite often errors are found, from which some may compromise the security of the computer where it is installed. JAP therefore indicates updates for your Java, and we strongly recommend to do such an update as soon as possible. Moreover, you should always <a href="noactive_en.html">deactivate the plugin in your browser</a>, as its execution may lead to a deanonymisation of your internet connection, despite an active JAP.
<P>Although Java supports contemporary installations of different versions, you should furthermore have only <a href="http://sunsolve.sun.com/search/document.do?assetkey=1-26-102557-1">ONE Java version installed on your computer</a>. Therefore uninstall all old versions of this software before performing the new Java installation.
<P>
