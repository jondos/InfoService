<H2>Functionality - in a nutshell </H2>
<h3>What JAP is NOT</h3>
<ul>
  <li>JAP does NOT hide the IP address of your computer (!) </li>
  <li>JAP is NO anonymisation tool for filesharing </li>
  <li>JAP CANNOT anonymise E-Mails (except for web mailers)</li>
  <li>JAP does NOT integrate transparently into your system, but has to be <a href="browser_en.html">configured</a> separately for each anonymised application</li>
  <li>JAP does NOT accelerate your web access </li>
  <li>JAP is NOT AN.ON (AN.ON is the service provided, JAP is the client application for accessing this service)</li>
  <li>JAP CANNOT use arbitrary &quot;anonymous&quot; proxies (for example from lists of open proxies) to establish an anonymous connection. This does only work with AN.ON Mix Cascades, that are <a href="certificates_en.html">certified</a>, automatically listed in JAP and do not need to be entered manually. </li>
  <li>JAP does NOT periodically change its IP address, but keeps the same IP address as long as it is connected to the same Mix Cascade. This may last minutes, hours or even days.</li>
  <li>JAP is NO One-Click-Anonymisation tool - something like that does and will not really exist!</li>
  <li>JAP does NOT (yet) filter out <a href="noactive_de.html">scripts and browser information</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>What JAP is </h3>
<ul>
  <li>JAP is an application for conceiling the own IP address when accessing the web with anonymised applications (<a href="supportedPrograms_en.html">HTTP, FTP-Downloads</a>)</li>
  <li>JAP is an anti-censorship application (especially by <a href="forwarding_server_en.html">Fowarding-Server</a>/<a href="forwarding_client_en.html">Forwarding-Client</a>) that enables access to otherwise blocked websites</li>
  <li>JAP is open source </li>
  <li>JAP is free of charge </li>
  <li>JAP is available for virtually all operating systems </li>
  <li>JAP may be used (even commercial, except for the name) and modified by everyone</li>
  <li>JAP is enhanced and developed in cooperation with german universities (<a href="http://dud.inf.tu-dresden.de">TU Dresden</a>, <a href="http://www-sec.uni-regensburg.de">Universit&auml;t Regensburg</a>) and privacy protection organisations (<a href="http://www.datenschutzzentrum.de" target="_blank">Independe</a><a href="http://www.datenschutzzentrum.de" target="_blank">nt Centre for Privacy Protection  Schleswig-Holstein</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h3>What AN.ON is </h3>
<ul>
  <li>AN.ON is the term for the anonymiser service that JAP connects to</li>
  <li>AN.ON consists of many Mix Cascades of different length (2-4 Mixes) with different and independent Organisations as operators of the individual Mixes, respective</li>
  <li>An AN.ON umbrella organisation (called AN.ON, too) independent from the operators guards the reliability of the individual operator organisations</li>
  <li>AN.ON is partially operated with costs for the users in order to finance enhancements of the software, the preservation of the umbrella organisation and the costs for operating the servers</li>
</ul>
