<H2>Supported programs </H2>
<p>JAP currenty only supports the following internet protocols:</p>
<ul>
  <li>HTTP</li>
  <li>HTTPS</li>
  <li>FTP (download via web browser only)</li>
  <li>Gopher</li>
</ul>
<p>These are typical programs supported by JAP:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="browser_en.html">Webbrowsers</a></li>
  <li>Download-Managers</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, JAP is mainly suitable for anonymous web browsing. The following applications are <strong>not supported</strong> by JAP:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Filesharing, Peer-To-Peer (Emule, BitTorrent, BitComet,...) </li>
  <li>Chat, Instant Messaging (ICQ, AIM, Yahoo Messenger,...) </li>
  <li>E-Mail</li>
  <li>Internet telephony (VoIP, Skype,...)</li>
  <li>FTP, Telnet, SSH,... </li>
</ul>
<p>Nevertheless, you find hints on the net that explain how to anonymise the mentioned applications with JAP. They are kind of alchemy and do not work really. Some of these connections, like Skype, may be run over JAP theoretically, but this does not anonymise them, only the traffic is forwarded. The Skype operator himself can deanonymise each of the communication connections with ease, despite the Mixes in the middle.
