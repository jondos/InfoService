    <LI><B>Version</B><BR>
    Here you see the version number of the JAP program that is installed on your system.
    <P>
    <LI><B>Date</B><BR>
    This field shows the timestamp of the currently installed version.
    <P>
    <LI><B>Type</B><BR>
    The type of the currently installed version is displayed here.  There are two possible types:  The "Release Version" has been thoroughly tested and includes only the functions that should have no bugs or conflicts.  The "Development Version" includes all functions that are available, even if they are only partially implemented or contain bugs or mistakes.
    <br>
    For most users, we recommend the "Release Version".

<P>
<H3>Latest Version</H3>
<P>
This area contains the same fields as the "Installed Version" area. The information in these fields also corresponds to the fields in the "Installed Version" area.  However, the information does not refer to the software currently installed on your system but rather refers to the JAP version that can currently be downloaded.  Using the drop-down menu "Type", you can choose whether the information for the "Release Version" or "Development Version" is displayed.
