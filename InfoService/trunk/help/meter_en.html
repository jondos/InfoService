Anonym-O-Meter</h2>
<b>Office Capacity Feedback</b>
<p>The register card Anonym-o-meter informs the users about the anonymizing
service’s current capacity. This includes:
<ul>
<li>
The number of the currently active users who are connected to the internet
and who have activated the anonymous access in the JAP.</li>

<li>
The traffic situation e.i. the amount of data per time unit that is processed
and transmitted by the mixes of the cascade.</li>
</ul>
From this information, a partly subjective observation risk and an achievable
anonymity standard can be derived. The more users are active and send or
receive messages, the larger is the anonymity group of every single message
send to the web because potentially every user could have sent it. Assuming
that the attacker controls a certain number of users or simulates apparent
users, his difficulties with controlling all users but one increase with
the growth of the anonymity group. In future versions, this kind of attack
is going to be prevented by a new registration procedure. The users register
at the mixes by so-called tickets, e.i. digital access permissions given
to pseudonyms by use of so-called blind digital signatures.
<p><b>Service-related Traffic</b>
<p>For the users’ information and the functionality examination, the JAP
shows how many data of the users in the current session have been transferred
via the anonymizing service so far and how many channels have currently
been set up via the JAP by other applications such as the web browser.
In general, several channels are being set up, even if you use only one
application and open only one web page, because the webpages may contain
multiple embedded objects that are opened one by one by the browser.
