<B>Feedback about the protection level</B>

<P>
The register card Anonym-o-meter informs you about the about the current
protection level. This includes:

<UL>
    <LI> The number of the currently active users who are connected to the anon
    service.
    <LI> The traffic situation i.e. the amount of data per time unit that is
    processed and transmitted by the anon service.
</UL>

<P>
From this information, a partly subjective risk of observation and
protection level can be derived. The more users are active and send or
receive messages, the larger is the anonymity group. Every single message
sent to the web is anonymous within this anonymity group. Assuming that the
attacker controls a certain number of users or simulates apparent users,
his difficulties with controlling all users but one increase with the
growth of the anonymity group.

<P>
In future versions, the protection will be increased by a new registration
procedure. The users register at the mixes by so-called tickets, i.e.
digital permissions given to pseudonyms by use of so-called blind digital
signatures.

<B>Service-related Traffic</B>

<P>
For the user's information and as an evidence of working correctly, JAP
shows how many data in the current session has been transferred via the
anonymizing service and how many channels have currently been used. In
general, several channels are being set up, even if you use only one
application and open only one web page, because the webpages may contain
multiple embedded objects that are opened one by one by the browser.
