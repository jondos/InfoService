<i>This panel is only available in <a href="appearance_en.html#expertView">Extended View</a>.</i><P>

	<LI><B>Assignment of internet services to anonymizer services</B><BR>
	This overview shows which internet service is assigned to which anonymizer service. Future releases of JAP will allow you to set your own assignments. Meanwhile, this is merely for your information.
	<P>
    <LI><B>Deny all data traffic without call back if anonymous mode is switched off</B><BR>
    If this box is checked, JAP will not transfer non-anonymous traffic. Your browser will show a hint which says that browsing the web is currently not possible.
    <br>If you do NOT check this box, JAP will show a warning window which has the option to allow non-anonymous browsing for a short amount of time.

    <P>
    <LI><B>Auto connect after program start</B><BR>
    If this box is checked, JAP automatically connects to the anonymization service when JAP is started.
    <P>
    <LI><B>Auto re-connect after connection to mix was lost</B><BR>
    Check this box if you want JAP to automatically reconnect to the anonymization service if the connection is lost.
    <P>
    <LI><B>Automatically change Mix cascades</B><BR>
    With this option activated, JAP will choose a cascade by chance<!-- according to your <a href="jap.JAPConfTrust_en.html">trust settings</a>-->. During anonymous browsing, however, cascades will only be switched if the active cascade is offline.
      <P>
  <LI><B>Send dummy packet</B><BR>
    Here you can decide if fake packets without any content should be sent and if so, how often.  This simulates continuous communication for any potential observers.
      <P>
    <LI><B>Login timeout</B><br>
  If your internet connection is too slow, a too short timeout for the login to services may lead prevent JAP from establishing an anonymous connection. A too high timeout may cause long waiting times when connecting if the currently chosen service is slow or not available. Therefore set the timeout lower or higher as you need.
