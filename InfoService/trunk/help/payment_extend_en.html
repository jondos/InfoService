<UL>
    <LI><B>Show confirm dialog before using a service with costs</B><BR>
    Activating this option will cause JAP to display a confirmation dialog each time a service with costs is about to be used. This also means that JAP will not be able to connect to a service with costs automatically during startup.
    <P>
    <LI><B>Allow non-anonymous connections to payment instances</B><BR>
    It is recommended to activate this option. Thereby JAP can get information about your account balance even if you have no anonymized connection currently established.<br>
    If this option is deactivated, account information may be gathered through anonymized connections only.
    <P>
    <LI><B>Automatically update account balance</B><BR>
    If activated, JAP will try to update your account balance at fixed intervals.
