you can configure how many status and error messages
on the so-called console (e.g.
in the DOS window) will be displayed.
If you encounter any
problems while using JAP, you
can probably locate them with help od these error messages. If you are not
able to find the solution and therefore ask us for help, please include the
corresponding messages in your e-mail.

<P>
You can choose to receive the messages referring to a certain area by
activating the corresponding check box. In the slider you can
configure how
important the displayed messages have to be. If you choose "Debug", all
messages will be shown. Level "Emergency" displays only messages which
refer to serious problems that prevent the service from working properly.
