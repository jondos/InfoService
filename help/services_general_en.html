<UL>
	<LI><B>Assignment of internet services to anonymizer services</B><BR>
	This overview shows which internet service is assigned to which anonymizer service. Future releases of JAP will allow you to set your own assignments. Meanwhile, this is merely for your information.
	<P>
    <LI><B>Deny all data traffic without call back if anonymous mode is switched off</B><BR>
    If this box is checked, JAP will not transfer non-anonymous traffic. Your browser will show a hint which says that browsing the web is currently not possible.
    <br>If you do NOT check this box, JAP will show a warning window which has the option to allow non-anonymous browsing for a short amount of time.
    <br><A href="jap.JAPController_allowunprotected_en.html">More information</A>
    <P>
    <LI><B>Auto connect after program start</B><BR>
    If this box is checked, JAP automatically connects to the anonymization service when JAP is started.
    <P>
    <LI><B>Auto re-connect after connection to mix was lost</B><BR>
    Check this box if you want JAP to automatically reconnect to the anonymization service if the connection is lost.
    <P>
    <LI><B>Automatically change Mix cascades</B><BR>
    Checking this box will give you two more options:<P>
    <UL>
    <LI><B>Equally choose all cascades</B><BR>
    With this option activated, JAP will choose a cascade by chance. During anonymous browsing, however, cascades will only be switched if the active cascade is offline.
    <P>
    <LI><B>Only choose payment cascades</B><BR>
    Similar to the first option, with the distinction that the random cascade will exclusively be chosen from payment cascades.
    <P>
    </UL>
    <P>
    <LI><B>Send dummy packet every x seconds</B><BR>
    Here you can decide if fake packets without any content should be sent and if so, how often.  This simulates continuous communication for any potential observers.
