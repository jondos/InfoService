Listener Port Number</h2>
To make sure that the JAP is able to anonymize the communication with the
internet, it has to be interposed between the browser and the server in
the internet. Such an in-between station is generally called proxy. Most
applications that communicate with the internet can direct their connections
via such a proxy. The necessary statements for this are: The name of the
computer (host) on which the proxy is operated, and the port number via
which the proxy receives requests. The default port number of the JAP is
4001. This configuration can be stuck to in nearly all cases.
<p><b>Essential configurations at the web browser</b>
<p>For making sure that your web browser sends its requests to the web
actually via the JAP, you have to configure it in a way that it uses the
JAP as a proxy. Generally, you use the following procedure:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Identify the proxy configuration
in the browser settings.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Activate the proxy modus (use
proxy server).
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enter <b>127.0.0.1</b>&nbsp;
into the field Host, and then enter the port number configured in the JAP
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Standard:
<b>4001</b>) into the field Port.

<p><b>Changing the port number in the JAP</b>
<p>In very rare cases it can become necessary to change the port number,
e.g. if the default port is already being used by another application in
your system. On the register card C<i>onfiguration</i> the current port
number of the JAP is being displayed in the top frame, which is called
<i>Listener
Port Number</i>. Below this, the current status of usage is being displayed.
If the port is actually in use, the display shows
<b>Status: activ</b>.
<p>For changing the port number, proceed as follows:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click <b>Settings</b> next to
the port number display.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enter the desired port number.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click <b>OK</b>.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Check if the desired port number
can be used (<b>Status: aktiv</b> must be displayed).
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If this
is not the case, try another port number.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Change the configurations of
your web browser respectively.
