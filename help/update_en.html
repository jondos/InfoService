<B>New Versions of JAP</B>

<P>
As soon as the application connects to the anon service, it checks  for new 
versions of JAP via Info Service. If there is a new version available, it 
is downloaded after confirmation by the user.

<P>
Since the transfer protocols may change with every new version, older 
versions cannot be used any longer.

<P>
Since the automatic update takes place while connecting to the anon 
service, no additional risk of being observed will arise. In future 
versions, the downloaded new version has to examine an integrity check to 
make sure you have received an software that has not been modified by 
attackers.

<P>
If you do not wish automatic updates, you can manually download the newest 
versions from the JAP website.

<P>
Particularly if you want to compile the source codes by yourself, you have 
to update manually.
