Update</h2>
<b>New Versions of JAP</b>
<p>As soon as the application is to connect to the anon service, it checks
via Info Service for new versions of JAP. If there is a new version available,
it is downloaded after confirmation by the user.
<p>Since the transfer protocols may change with every new version, older
versions cannot be used with the anon service any longer.
<p>Since the automatic update function&nbsp; takes place parallel to the
log-in at the anon service, no additional risk of being observed will arise.
In future versions, the downloaded new version is going to be examined
on integrity (genuineness) to make sure that you have received an original
that has not been altered by attackers.
<p>If you do not wish automatic updates, you can download the newest versions
manually from the JAP website
<ul><LU><b>http://anon.inf.tu-dresden.de</b></ul>
Particularly if you want to translate the source codes yourself, you have
to update manually.
