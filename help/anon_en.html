<B>How to use the anonymizing service</B>

<P>
On the register card <I>Configuration</I>, the settings and the current 
status of the JAP concerning the connection to the anon service is  
displayed the within option <I>Anonymity</I>. If the check box <B>Activate 
anonymous access</B> is activated, the JAP directs all requests through the 
anon service. Directly below this, the URL of the first mix is  
displayed. Additionally, there is a status display that provides 
information about the service's usability. If you want to surf 
anonymously, it must show <I>Status: active</I>.

<P>
Please note that you must have connected to the Internet before activating 
anonymous access, since JAP establishes a permanent connection to the first 
mix. This connection still remains active even if you don't send any 
requests, since status information is periodically exchanged.

<P>
Please note that - as long as the anonymous access is activated - the automatic disconnection  
after a certain time of inactivity does not work, 
since JAP permanently gets status information from the Info Service.

<P>
<B>Configuration</B>

<P>
You can change the URL of the anon service if you want to use a different 
mix cascade. For this please click on the button <B>Change</B>.

<P>
Now there are three possibilities to choose another anon service:

<UL>
    <LI> You can ask Info Service to update the locally stored list of anon 
    services. For this, choose <B>Fetch</B> and click the button. 
    This procedure updates the local database.
    <LI> From the local database you can select an anon service by choosing 
    <B>Select Anon Server</B> and clicking on the name of one of the anon 
    service in the opened dropdown menu.
    <LI> Apart from this you have the opportunity to enter the URL of the anon 
    service manually.
</UL>

<P>
Manually entering the anon service makes sense 
if there are alternative operators of mix cascades who work with the JAP 
protocol. Normally, only the first two settings should be 
used.
