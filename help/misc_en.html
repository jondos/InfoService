Miscellaneous</h2>
If you click <b>Settings</b> or <b>Change </b>on the register card C<i>onfiguration</i>,
a new window is opened which contains the register card <i>Miscellaneous</i>
among other configuration opportunities.
<p>On the card <b>Miscellaneous</b>, you can define the language used by
the operating platform and change the <b>Look-and-Feel</b> in future versions.
<p>The setting opportunities are currently restricted to the <b>Debbugging</b>.
In this place you can configure the extent to which status and error messages
will be displayed on the so-called console (e.g. in the DOS window). If
there are any problems occurring with the JAP, you can probably locate
them according to these error messages. If you are not able to find the
solution and therefore ask us for help, please include the corresponding
messages in your e-mail.
<p>You can choose to receive the messages referring to a certain area by
activating the corresponding check. At Level, you can configure how important
the displayed messages have to be. If you choose level 0, all messages
will be shown. Level 7 leads to displaying only messages which refer to
serious problems that prevent the service from working properly.
