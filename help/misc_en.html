Here
you can configure how many status and error messages 
on the so-called console (e.g. 
in the DOS window) will be displayed. 
If you encounter any 
problems while using JAP, you 
can probably locate them with help od these error messages. If you are not 
able to find the solution and therefore ask us for help, please include the 
corresponding messages in your e-mail.

<P>
You can choose to receive the messages referring to a certain area by 
activating the corresponding check box. In the slider you can 
configure how 
important the displayed messages have to be. If you choose "Debug", all 
messages will be shown. Level "Emergency" displays only messages which 
refer to serious problems that prevent the service from working properly.
