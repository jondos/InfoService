		<BR>You may add new look and feel options by downloading some from the internet and importing them to JAP.
		You need no packages created specifically for JAP, instead you may use every look and feel package suitable for java.
		<BR>Such packages can be found at <A HREF="http://www.javootoo.com">www.javootoo.com</A>.
		After downloading a package, klick <i>Import</i> to add this look and feel.
