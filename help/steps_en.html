Steps</h2>
<b>Surfing anonymously</b>
<p>After having successfully loaded and started the Java Anon Proxy, you
have to take the following steps to be able to surf the web anonymously.
<ul>
<li>
Connect your computer to the internet.</li>

<li>
Click the button next to "Activate anonymous access".</li>

<br>As soon as the check is set and "Status: active" is displayed, the
JAP can send web requests anonymously.
<li>
Configure the JAP in your browser as HTTP proxy.</li>

<br>For this you have to enter the following data in the proxy settings:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Host: <b>127.0.0.1</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Port: <b>4001</b>
<br>On request, we can provide you with a <a href="listen_en.html">detailed
description (Listener Port Number)</a>.</ul>
Now you can surf anonymously. For your protection, you should also deactivate
the cookie option in your browser since the operators of servers are able
to reconstruct your surf behavior by sending these files. As long as you
do not reveal your identity directly, though, it is not possible for the
server to find it out.
<p>You should note that your browser is going to try to again establish
a connection to the JAP in when you start the next internet session. To
be able to surf anonymously, you have to start the JAP anew and activate
"Anonymous access" option. If you do not wish to do this, you have to reset
the proxy settings in your browser.
