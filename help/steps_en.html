<B>Surfing anonymously</B>



<P>

After having successfully loaded and started the Java Anon Proxy, you will 

have to take the following steps to be able to surf the web anonymously.



<UL>

    <LI> Connect your computer to the internet.

    <LI> Click the check box "Activate anonymous access".  As soon as the check 

    is set and "Status: active" is displayed, JAP can send web requests 

    anonymously.

    <LI> Configure your browser that it uses JAP as HTTP proxy. Enter the 

    following data into the proxy settings: <BR>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Host: <B>127.0.0.1</B> <BR>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Port: <B>4001</B> <BR>

    <A HREF="listen_en.html">More Detailed description (Listener Port 

    Number).</A>

</UL>



<P>

Now you can surf anonymously. For your protection, you should deactivate 

Cookies in your browser. Otherwise, the operators of web servers might be 

able to reconstruct your surf behavior by means of sending and receiving 

Cookies. As long as you do not reveal your identity directly, though, it is 

not possible for the server to find it out.



<P>

As long as your browser's configuration has been changed, all web 

connections are going through JAP. Note that you have to start your browser 

as well as JAP to surf the Internet anonymously. Also, you have to activate 

the "Anonymous access" option in JAP. If you do not wish any longer to surf 

anonymouly you must reset the proxy settings in your browser.
