<P>
Here you can find information about the AN.ON project's anonymization service.
<UL>
    <LI><B>Available services</B><BR>
    This list contains the names of all anonymization services that can currently be accessed.  The service selected in your JAP client is highlighted in bold font.  If you click on a service name, you can see further information about that service.
    <P>
    <UL>
        <LI><B>Users</B><BR>
        This field shows the number of users that are currently connected to the selected service.
        <P>
        <LI><B>Reachable by</B><BR>
        Here you can see the host name or IP address under which the service can be reached.  This address must be open in your firewall for outgoing connections if you want to use that service.
        <P>
        <LI><B>Ports</B><BR>
        The service accepts connections on these port numbers.  at least one of these ports needs to be open on your firewall for the address above.

    Clicking this button causes JAP to request a new list of available services from the InfoService.
    <P>
    <LI><B>Select</B><BR>
    This button sets the currently selected service to the activated service.  JAP will try to set up a connection to this service when it is turned to "On" in the main window.
    <P>
    <LI><B>Manual</B><BR>
    If a service is not recognized as available by the InfoService, you can manually add the service with this button, if you know the login information for that service.  After clicking on the button, the following fields appear in the bottom half of the window:
    <P>
    <UL>

<H3>Tor</H3>
Under this tab, you can find information and settings for the Tor anonymization network.
<BR>If you would like to use JAP to access the Tor network, you will need to enter JAP as a Socks proxy in your browser, rather than as an HTTP/HTTPS proxy.

<UL>
    <LI><B>Available Tor Nodes</B><BR>
    This tab shows other computers that are a part of the Tor network and offer a connection to the Tor network.
    <P>
    <LI><B>Fetch list</B><BR>
    This button retrieves an updated list of currently accesible Tor nodes.
    <P>
    <LI><B>Preferences for anonymous routing</B><BR>
    <P>
    <UL>
        <LI><B>Minimal nodes per connection</B><BR>
        Here you can set the minimum number of Tor nodes through which a connection should be routed before being connected to the destination computer.  The more nodes you use, the more effective the anonymization of the connection.
        <P>
        <LI><B>Maximal nodes per connection</B><BR>
        This slider sets the maximum number of Tor nodes used for a connection.  The larger this number, the slower the connection will be.
        <P>
        <LI><B>Change route every x connections</B><BR>
        Here you can set how often a new route should be established.  Whenever this number of connections has been established, the old route is discarded and a new route through the Tor network is established.
        <P>
        <LI><B>pre-create anonymous routes</B><BR>
        If this box is checked, JAP automatically establishes a route through the Tor network upon startup.  If it's not checked, a route is not established until a connection is made.

<H3>General</H3>
<UL>
    <LI><B>Auto connect after program start</B><BR>
    If this box is checked, JAP automatically connects to the anonymization service when JAP is started.

    <LI><B>Auto re-connect after connection to mix was lost</B><BR>
    Check this box if you want JAP to automatically reconnect to the anonymization service if the connection is lost.
    <P>
    <LI><B>Send dummy packet every x seconds</B><BR>
    Here you can decide if fake packets without any content should be sent and if so, how often.  This simulates continuous communication for any potential observers.
    <P>
    <LI><B>Use non-certified servers</B><BR>
    If this box is checked, servers that don't have valid certificates will be used in addition to those that do.  For security reasons, this option should not be activated.
