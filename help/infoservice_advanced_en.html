<P>
<UL>
    <LI><B>Enable automatic InfoService Requests</B><BR>
    JAP occassionally attempts to automatically connect to the InfoService to request information.  If this checkbox is activated, these automatic connections are also activated.
    <P>
    <LI><B>Allow non-anonymous connections to InfoServices</B><BR>
    If activated, JAP can connect to InfoServices even if you have no anonymized connection currently established.<br>
    If this option is deactivated, information from InfoServices may be gathered through anonymized connections only.<br>
    Thus, it is recommended to activate this option, since no other InfoService will be used if this one is offline.
    <P>
    <LI><B>Use only the default InfoService (Only available in development version)</B><BR>
    Normally, JAP attempts to obtain information from all known InfoServices if the standard InfoService cannot deliver the information.  When this checkbox is activated, only the standard InfoService will be connected to.
    <br>This is NOT recommended.
    <br>If this option is NOT activated, you have one more option to set:
    <P>
    <UL>
    <LI><B>Number of redundant InfoService queries:</B><BR>
    Define how many InfoServices will be queried. If you set this value to "3", for example, JAP will always try to reach 3 InfoServices. Should one of them appear to be offline, JAP will try to reach a substitute.
    <br>The higher the value, the more fail safe JAP will become, the more time these queries will consume, however.
    </UL>
