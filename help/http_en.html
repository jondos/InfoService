Unfortunately, the function http Proxy has not been implemented so far.
<p>Some users cannot use the anon service directly. This is the case if
you cannot connect to the first mix due to a firewall. On top of that,
there are some internet providers who prescribe the use of a particular
HTTP proxy.
<p>For these users, the connection to the first mix is going to be tunneled
through the HTTP protocol and sent via a proxy chosen by the user in future
versions. The proxy that is to be used can be configured in this place.
<p>Another advantage of this function is the opportunity to avoid censorship
by the provider or the state in which the user lives. The direct usage
of the anon service could be prevented by blocking the address, though,
but this goes not for the usage via any chosen proxy. By using this method,
an observing third party couldn’t even identify the usage of an anon service.
