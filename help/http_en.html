<P>
Unfortunately, the function <B>HTTP Proxy</B> has not been implemented so 
far.

<P>
Some users cannot use the anon service directly. They cannot connect 
connect to the first mix, since a firewall blocks the direct connection. 
Additionally, some Internet Service Provicers force their customers to use 
a a particular HTTP proxy.

<P>
In future versions of JAP, the connection to the first mix can be tunneled 
over the HTTP protocol and through a proxy or firewall.

<P>
Another advantage of this function is that it avoids censorship by the 
provider or the government. The direct usage of the anon service may be 
blocked by the provider. Nevertheless, connecting the anon service via a 
proxy will be possible. This way, an observing third party couldn't even 
determine the usage of an anon service.
